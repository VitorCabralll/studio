## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4F46E5) for a professional yet modern feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#1A202C) for the default dark theme, providing a sleek and focused environment. 
- Accent color: Teal (#14B8A6), providing a vibrant contrast against the dark background to draw attention to key interactive elements without being distracting. This will serve as a secondary brand highlight.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to maintain a contemporary, precise, fashionable, avant-garde look. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as it pairs nicely with Poppins and is suitable for longer text blocks.
- Utilize `lucide-react` icons throughout the application, maintaining a consistent, minimalist aesthetic.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes, using Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox utilities.
- Use subtle transition animations for UI elements to enhance user experience and provide feedback on interactions.
